I'm no John Carmack, and people aren't clamoring to read what I have to say. When I do feel like I have something useful to contribute, I'll post it here.

I had a Drupal blog at this domain previously, which I will not attempt to migrate. Comments and site updates were a hassle. I'm going to try generating a static site via GitHub Pages for far lower overhead. If you want to get in touch, feel free to do so over GitHub, LinkedIn, or email. Cheers!
